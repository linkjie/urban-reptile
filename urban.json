        "mean": "Gun fu is the style of sophisticated close-quarters gunplay seen in Hong Kong action cinema and in Western films influenced by it. It often resembles a martial arts battle played out with firearms instead of traditional weapons.The focus of gun fu is style, and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand, shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons are all common. Other moves can involve shotguns, Uzis, rocket launchers, and just about anything else that can be worked into a cinematic shot. It is often mixed with hand-to-hand combat maneuvers.\"Gun fu\" has become a staple factor in modern action films due to its visually appealing nature (regardless of its actual practicality in a real-life combat situation). This is a contrast to American action movies of the 1980s which focused more on heavy weaponry and outright brute-force in firearm-based combat.",
        "example": "Before 1986, Hong Kong cinema was firmly rooted in two genres: the martial arts film and the comedy. Gunplay was not terribly popular because audiences had considered it boring, compared to fancy kung-fu moves or graceful swordplay of the wu shu epics. What moviegoers needed was a new way to present gunplay-- to show it as a skill that could be honed, integrating the acrobatics and grace of the traditional martial arts. And that's exactly what John Woo did. Using all of the visual techniques available to him (tracking shots, dolly-ins, slo-mo), Woo created beautifully surrealistic action sequences that were a 'guilty pleasure' to watch. There is also intimacy found in the gunplay-- typically, his protagonists and antagonists will have a profound understanding of one another and will meet face-to-face, in a tense Mexican standoff where they each point their weapons at one another and trade words.The popularity of John Woo's films, and the heroic bloodshed genre in general, in the West helped give the gun fu style greater visibility. Film-makers like Robert Rodriguez were inspired to create action sequences modelled on the Hong Kong style. One of the first to demonstrate this was Rodriguez's Desperado (1995). The Matrix (1999) played a part in making \"gun fu\" the most popular form of firearm-based combat in cinema worldwide; since then, the style has become a staple of modern Western action films."

The term has entered into popular culture, to mean a loser or someone who is worthless, as well as its Italian equivalent, jabroni, a phrase that was made popular by The Rock. Former alternate terms included journeyman (because of jobbers being hired for individual matches and not having contracts with the major promotions), enhancement talent (due to their usage to enhance the stature of their opponent) and ham-n-egger (in reference to the amount of money they make buys them just enough for a Ham and Egg breakfast).\n\nDespite the negative sense of the word, some wrestlers have made a career out of jobbing. Barry Horowitz and Steve Lombardi (better known as the \"Brooklyn Brawler\") made a career out of jobbing, primarily in the World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nA slightly higher position is jobber to the stars, which is a wrestler who still defeats pure jobbers but who consistently loses to top-level or up-and-coming stars. This often happens to popular faces towards the end of their careers, including Tony Garea and Tito Santana. Triple H was given this role from 1996-1997 by Vince McMahon as punishment for the infamous MSG Incident.\n\nMany top names in wrestling began their careers as jobbers. Mick Foley and Bret Hart began their careers as jobbers in the 1980s, later going on to greater success in the 1990s after employers began to recognize their talent. Peter Polaco and Terry Gerin were jobbers who later became stars in ECW as Justin Credible and Rhino, respectively.",

The problem is not that we have a handful of new superhero movies every year, but that they feel very similar to each other, and not in a good way. If the undeniable success of movies like Wonder Woman tell us anything is that audiences are starving for stories that break the usual pattern of superhero films.Three patterns in particular that can be causing superhero fatigue are as follows: 1) Tone - sometimes you need the bleakness to make your point, as with dystopian novels. 2) Story - Superhero movies are often repetitive in the basic narrative structure they choose, giving us the feeling that we’ve seen that story before. 3) Characters - This is probably the core of superhero fatigue, since you can’t have a great range of stories when they’re always about the same people. Different identities bring in different perspectives and different ways to interact with the world.",

        "mean": "One who smithes (or \"forges\" is you're a purist) blades.  Which, by the old ways would involve:  Heating an iron rod to cherry red in a forge, and hammering into whatever shape you wish your sword to be.  Iron is lighter than steel, but doesn't hold an edge as long.  So, many times, the bladesmith would turn the blade on edge, and with a hammer and chisel, would split the edge of the blade in for a half inche or so, and insert an edge of steel.  They would then re-heat the item, and hammer the iron down onto the inserted steel, fusing them together.  They would then temper the blade by heating the entire piece to cherry-red, and then submerging it in water, or oil.  This would harden the blade.  However, if left like this the sword would be to hard and brittle to use, and would break opon the first blow.  So they would then re-heat the blade to a deep red, and stick it in dry ashes to cool slowly.  This would partly anealIn this way, they would aneal, or soften the metal, while not entirely removing the temper.  The would then be hard enough to use in battle, but soft enough, and springy enough, that in wouldn't shatter on impact.  They would then polish and sharpen the blade.  In this way the smiths would create a sword with a steel edge, but that wieghed much less than a sword of only steel.\nThe modern way is to:  Use a high-speed grinder to grind a bar of steel down into the shape of the blade you wish to make, then switch to a finer grinding wheel, and finally a buffing wheel to polish.  With a whet stone, you can then put an edge on it.  The modern method isn't nearly as good as the old methods, though.  Sword created by this method are really only good as display models.  It's a shame that so many of the ancient ways have been lost.  In this era, you could spend your whole life studying the art of bladesmithing, and never even come close to the skill level of an apprintice.  The blades of old could cut through solid stone without scratching the metal.  Many of them had edges that where only a few atoms in width, but were strong enough to slice through armor like paper.  With the finest, you could hold the sword out in front of you, and a silk cloth dropped on it would be cut cleanly in two, of its own wieght.  Smiths were held in the highest regard in the middle ages, placed in the same ranks as the priests and poets.  The smith was the only craftsmen to work with all four of the basic elements (for they belived in only four at that time).  He used fire in his forge, air in his bellows, to blow the fire hotter, water to quinch the metal, and earth, the iron he used.  (iron was known as the \"black metal,\" the metal of the earth.)\n     There are still many people who blacksmith and bladesmith as a hobby.  (I, am of course, one of them.)  It really is a wonderful hobby to take up.  Anybody can do it, it just takes a lot of work.  (I'm only 15.)\n     It's a very rewarding and interesting thing to do!

The term has entered into popular culture, to mean a loser or someone who is worthless, as well as its Italian equivalent, jabroni, a phrase that was made popular by The Rock. Former alternate terms included journeyman (because of jobbers being hired for individual matches and not having contracts with the major promotions), enhancement talent (due to their usage to enhance the stature of their opponent) and ham-n-egger (in reference to the amount of money they make buys them just enough for a Ham and Egg breakfast).\n\nDespite the negative sense of the word, some wrestlers have made a career out of jobbing. Barry Horowitz and Steve Lombardi (better known as the \"Brooklyn Brawler\") made a career out of jobbing, primarily in the World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nA slightly higher position is jobber to the stars, which is a wrestler who still defeats pure jobbers but who consistently loses to top-level or up-and-coming stars. This often happens to popular faces towards the end of their careers, including Tony Garea and Tito Santana. Triple H was given this role from 1996-1997 by Vince McMahon as punishment for the infamous MSG Incident.\n\nMany top names in wrestling began their careers as jobbers. Mick Foley and Bret Hart began their careers as jobbers in the 1980s, later going on to greater success in the 1990s after employers began to recognize their talent.

        "mean": "Gun fu is the style of sophisticated close-quarters gunplay seen in Hong Kong action cinema and in Western films influenced by it. It often resembles a martial arts battle played out with firearms instead of traditional weapons.The focus of gun fu is style, and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand, shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons are all common. Other moves can involve shotguns, Uzis, rocket launchers, and just about anything else that can be worked into a cinematic shot. It is often mixed with hand-to-hand combat maneuvers.\"Gun fu\" has become a staple factor in modern action films due to its visually appealing nature (regardless of its actual practicality in a real-life combat situation). This is a contrast to American action movies of the 1980s which focused more on heavy weaponry and outright brute-force in firearm-based combat.",
        "example": "Before 1986, Hong Kong cinema was firmly rooted in two genres: the martial arts film and the comedy. Gunplay was not terribly popular because audiences had considered it boring, compared to fancy kung-fu moves or graceful swordplay of the wu shu epics. What moviegoers needed was a new way to present gunplay-- to show it as a skill that could be honed, integrating the acrobatics and grace of the traditional martial arts. And that's exactly what John Woo did. Using all of the visual techniques available to him (tracking shots, dolly-ins, slo-mo), Woo created beautifully surrealistic action sequences that were a 'guilty pleasure' to watch. There is also intimacy found in the gunplay-- typically, his protagonists and antagonists will have a profound understanding of one another and will meet face-to-face, in a tense Mexican standoff where they each point their weapons at one another and trade words.The popularity of John Woo's films, and the heroic bloodshed genre in general, in the West helped give the gun fu style greater visibility. Film-makers like Robert Rodriguez were inspired to create action sequences modelled on the Hong Kong style. One of the first to demonstrate this was Rodriguez's Desperado (1995). The Matrix (1999) played a part in making \"gun fu\" the most popular form of firearm-based combat in cinema worldwide; since then, the style has become a staple of modern Western action films."

It was then adopted into the Welsh language to mean a cupboard. But Mr Shearing said the word's origins also lie in the french word \"coucher\" which means to lie down. There are also early recordings of people telling their dogs to \"cwtch in the corner\". But during this century the word has also taken on the meaning to hug.\n\n...The first recorded use of cwtch in English was during the 1920s and Elizabeth Taylor was also recorded as saying about Richard Burton, \"I just want to go and cwtch him.\"\n\n(Cultural historian Peter Stead): \"I have always used it in both its senses, a cupboard and a hug. When I first met my wife I often used to say, 'let's have a cwtch' and she was always very amused by it. And since then it's become part of our domestic life.\n\n...\"I think we are an emotional and sentimental nation of people. We do like hugging and we are very tactile not only with family but in public life as well. When I am meeting a friend, even if its a politician, we will often hug.

Verb, transitive.  To cause someone to have this reaction.\n4. Verb, intransitive.  To experience this reaction.\n\nThe concept of the \"squick\" differs from the concept of \"disgust\" in that \"squick\" refers purely to the physical sensation of repulsion, and does not imply a moral component.\n\nStating that something is \"disgusting\" implies a judgement that it is bad or wrong.  Stating that something \"squicks you\" is merely an observation of your reaction to it, but does not imply a judgement that such a thing is universally wrong.\n\nThe statement \"kiddie porn squicks me\" and \"kiddie porn disgusts me\" may both be true.  In my case, the second sentence is true, and I assume that the first is also true, but, having never encountered it, I have no way of knowing for sure.\n\nIn general, distinguishing between \"squick\" and \"disgust\" is an important part of living in a tolerant society.\n\nIt is my contention that most anti-gay attitudes, for instance, are the result of people finding that gay sex squicks them -- and, because they don't know about the concept of the \"squick\", they assume that gay sex DISGUSTS them, which implies that there is something morally objectionable about it.",

She wasn't the first diva or drama queen, but certainly the one who resonated the most to a generation of gays and lesbians. Garland's most famous role -- as the ever-optimistic and wistful Dorothy in the 1939 classic \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- gave gays and lesbians a \"secret\" code word which they could use to refer to themselves. At cocktail parties or company gatherings where one could not be comfortably \"out and proud,\" gays would inquire discreetly of each other, \"Are you a 'Friend of Dorothy?'\" The wink-wink admission of \"I am, too!\" would likely lead to fabulous and fast bonding in an age when gay bars were clandestine, and in some cases dangerous.\nToday, the term is used mostly by Baby Boomers and an older generation of gays and lesbians; the gay members of MTV kids and Generations X and Y would probably not recognize the meaning of \"FOD\" unless they learned it from some older friends!\n",

It is a character trait believed to be possessed by some individuals, in real life as well as in works of fiction, sometimes causing anti-social behaviours, often allegedly caused by an unpleasant past experience of intimate relationships. A person who suffers from the hedgehog's dilemma will usually avoid becoming too close or involved with someone, due to fear of another similar, possibly painful, experience, such as they had experienced in the past.",
